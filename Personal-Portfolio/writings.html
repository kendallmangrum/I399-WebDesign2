                        <p>For a few years now I have found myself writing short pieces and poems as a form of release and a creative outlet. I've never been the type of person to really share what I'm thinking so writing things down on paper serves
                            as a way to get things out of my mind. </p>
                        <p>Being an a quiet overthinking, my writings tend to be on the sad, depressing side but I think they carry some weight. Depending on the person reading them, they can hit home pretty hard. I hope you enjoy them.</p>

                                Isolated by myself like I&#39;m part of a zoo.</p>

                            <p>I just want someone to love and to hold<br>
                                Having someone for that would be worth more than gold<br>
                                But here I am, all alone and cold.</p>

                        <p>In her eyes the galaxies were kept.
                            Whenever I looked into them I saw the twinkling of countless stars.
                            I often got lost in her eyes; their beauty so alluring.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Her hair could be seen styled as the waves of the ocean,
                            Flowing gently from her head to just below the shoulders.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Her smile glowed like the moon;
                            Even in the darkest of rooms its light still shined bright.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Her soul was as free as the wind;
                            Nothing could contain her.
                            Her presence, or lack thereof, could always be felt.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Her personality radiated from her like the sun.
                            She had a warmth about her that could comfort any anxiety.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She meant the world to me.
                            When I held her in my arms I had everything I needed.
                            But just as the tide comes and goes,
                            So did she and now I&#39;m left without a world to call my own.</p>

                        <h4>Eternal Love</h4>
                        <p>You not loving me is a hard pill to swallow.<br>
                            I thought maybe you&#39;d change your mind, but you didn&#39;t and now I feel so hollow.<br>
                            <br>
                            I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever loved someone as much as I love you.<br>
                            It doesn&#39;t matter though, it just got my heart torn in two.<br>
                            <br>
                            Turns out that you&#39;re just my type,<br>
                            And I was down to be in a relationship feeling so hype.<br>
                            <br>
                            No one had ever made me feel the way you did. <br>
                            Deeper and deeper in love I slid.<br>
                            <br>
                            In my mind I kept thinking you were the one,<br>
                            But before I knew it the idea of &ldquo;us&rdquo; was done.<br>
                            <br>
                            But you&#39;re still figuring things out.<br>
                            A relationship with me at the time had you filled with doubt.<br>
                            <br>
                            I know I still have flaws but that&#39;s okay.<br>
                            I&#39;ll eventually be with someone, today&#39;s just not that day.<br>
                            <br>
                            And who knows, maybe someday everything will come full circle,<br>
                            And we&#39;ll end up together cause my love for you is eternal.</p>

                        <h4>Today's World</h4>
                        <p>Today&#39;s world is so messed up<br>
                            Filled with guys sliding into DMs just saying <q>sup</q><br>
                            People pretending to care<br>
                            Saying that they&#39;ll always be there<br>
                            But as soon as they find someone new<br>
                            They forget all about you<br>
                            It&#39;s starting to be hard finding someone who&#39;s true to their word<br>
                            Finding someone who truly wants the best for you, that&#39;s kinda unheard<br>
                            It seems like in today&#39;s world filled with Snapchat streaks<br>
                            That that&#39;s when people think their friendship is at its peak<br>
                            People don&#39;t really care about each other anymore<br>
                            As soon as they get the chance they walk right out the door<br>
                            Being surrounded by people who want things that are temporary<br>
                            Makes me feel like someone who isn&#39;t considered ordinary<br>
                            No, I want to love someone with all my heart and soul<br>
                            For them to complete me and make me feel whole<br>
                            I know I&#39;m not perfect but I&#39;ll give them my all<br>
                            I will always stand beside them and not let them fall<br>
                            I want us to be an example for all to see<br>
                            That our love for each other is how it&#39;s supposed to be</p>
